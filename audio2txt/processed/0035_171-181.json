  "perception": "1. The genre is a fusion of rock and electronic music, drawing from alternative and experimental influences.\n2. The instrumental composition includes a synthesizer, drums, bass, and electric guitar. The synthesizer adds a warm texture, the drums provide a steady beat, the bass offers depth, and the electric guitar introduces a distorted and aggressive edge to the sound.\n3. The vocals feature a male voice singing in English with a melancholic tone. The lyrics convey themes of introspection and longing.\n4. The atmosphere of the track is moody and atmospheric, evoking feelings of nostalgia and introspection. I would associate the track with a cool, dark blue color.\n5. Structurally, the track starts off sparse and quiet, featuring only the synthesizer and drums. As the song progresses, layers of instrumentation are added, culminating in a chaotic climax towards the end.\n6. The energy level of the track is dynamic, shifting between moments of calmness and intensity. There's a sense of building tension that leads up to the climax, making the track feel more exciting as it progresses.",
