  "perception": "This music can be categorized under the rock genre, specifically alternative rock. The instrumental composition includes a distorted electric guitar playing the lead, a bass guitar that complements the melody, and acoustic drums that add depth to the rhythm section. The overall feel is aggressive yet soothing, reminiscent of grunge rock but with a softer touch. Vocals are sparse, featuring a hauntingly beautiful female voice that adds to the melancholy atmosphere. The song has a slow build-up, starting off quiet and intimate before escalating into a loud, chaotic climax. The use of synthesizers contributes to the atmospheric texture, providing a warm backdrop to the raw guitar sounds. This track evokes a sense of rebellion and introspection, painting vivid pictures of dark, moody landscapes. It's a perfect soundtrack for a rainy day, reflecting one's inner turmoil in its complex layers of sound and emotion.",
